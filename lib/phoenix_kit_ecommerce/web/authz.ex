defmodule PhoenixKitEcommerce.Web.Authz do
  @moduledoc """
  Sub-permission checks for the bundled admin LiveViews.

  Core's route gate admits anyone holding the base `"shop"` key (or a sub,
  which implies the base). That is the right granularity for *reaching* the
  admin area, but not for acting inside it: a catalog editor should not be
  able to rewrite the security policy, and someone who only runs imports
  should not be reading customer contact details out of carts.

  Every mutating event handler in this module's admin LiveViews therefore
  re-checks the specific capability it needs, and the pages that display
  customer data check on mount.

  ## Scope of enforcement

  This is **bundled-UI policy**, and deliberately so. The public context API
  (`PhoenixKitEcommerce.create_product/1` and friends, including the
  `compat/shop.ex` re-exports) stays scope-less: it is a library, hosts call
  it from their own controllers, workers and scripts, and it cannot know
  whose authority those run under. Core says the same — sub-permissions are
  capabilities the module checks itself. Where a context function guards
  *ownership* (billing profiles, cart sessions) it keeps doing so
  regardless; those are invariants, not UI policy.

  Background jobs are authorized at ENQUEUE time by the LiveView that
  starts them; the workers themselves run without a scope by design.
