  # picking up a cart. As proof of ORDER ownership it is a capability, and an
  # unsigned value is replayable: anyone who obtains a real session id
  # out-of-band (a shared machine, a log, a Referer header) could present it
  # unsigned and read the victim's confirmation page. That is precisely what
  # signing was added to prevent, so `trusted` is false for the adopted case
  # and `PhoenixKitEcommerce.Web.CheckoutComplete` requires it to be true.
  #
  # The cost is one request: adoption re-issues the cookie signed, so the
  # visitor's NEXT request is trusted. Only a pre-upgrade order viewed on the
  # very first request after upgrading is affected.

  # the session that placed them (see `Policy.order_lookup_policy/0`) it is
  # also what proves "I am the guest who just checked out". It is therefore
  # signed: unsigned, a forged value picked up someone else's guest cart.
  #
  # `same_site: "Lax"` keeps it off cross-site requests, and `secure:` is

  # moment the shop upgraded — a real break for every deployed store, not a
  # theoretical one.
  #
  # Three things keep this narrow, because an unsigned value is replayable
  # by anyone who obtains one out-of-band, and this cookie now also proves
  # guest ORDER ownership — blindly trusting any unsigned string would hand
  # over exactly the capability signing was added to protect:
  #
  #   1. It must name a LIVE GUEST cart — active, unclaimed by any account
  #      (`Shop.session_has_cart?/1`). A guessed value matches nothing; a
  #      real session id is 32 crypto-random bytes.
  #   2. It never authorizes an order. Adopted ids are marked untrusted,
  #      and `CheckoutComplete` requires a trusted one.
  #   3. It expires. `Policy.legacy_cookie_window_open?/0` closes the door
  #      on a configured date. This is load-bearing: nothing deletes carts
  #      (`mark_abandoned_carts/1` only flips a status and is wired to no
  #      cron), so without a cutoff the criterion in (1) would stay
  #      satisfiable indefinitely and the window would never self-close.

  # issued a fresh id.
